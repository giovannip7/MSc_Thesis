\textbf{Motivation for the use of a simulator DA ADATTARE}
% In the last decade, one of the biggest drivers for success in machine learning has arguably been the rise of high-capacity models such as neural networks along with large datasets such as ImageNet to produce accurate models. While we have seen deep neural networks being applied to success in reinforcement learning (RL) in domains such as robotics, poker, board games, and team-based video games, a significant barrier to getting these methods working on real-world problems is the difficulty of large-scale online data collection. Not only is online data collection time-consuming and expensive, it can also be dangerous in safety-critical domains such as driving or healthcare. For example, it would be unreasonable to allow reinforcement learning agents to explore, make mistakes, and learn while controlling an autonomous vehicle or treating patients in a hospital. This makes learning from pre-collected experience enticing, and we are fortunate in that many of these domains, there already exist large datasets for applications such as self-driving cars, healthcare, or robotics.

\begin{equation}
    x_{1} = \frac{Navigated Distance}{Path Distance}

\begin{equation}
    x_{2} = \frac{Forward Average Speed}{Requested Speed}

\begin{equation}
    x_{3} = \frac{Target Navigation Time}{ Navigation Time}

\begin{equation}
    x_{4} = \frac{Target Rotation Time}{Rotation Time}

\begin{equation}
    NP = \frac{w_{1}*x_{1}+w_{2}*x_{2}+w_{3}*x_{3}+w_{4}*x_{4} }{w_{1} + w_{2} + w_{3} + w_{4}} 
    = \frac{15*x_{1}+30*x_{2}+25*x_{3}+30*x_{4}}{100}
