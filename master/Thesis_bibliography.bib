In this Chapter, we will deal with robot performance and reliability testing in particular. There are several types of performance testing techniques which have been used since the inception of the robot [1], [2]. The forms of performance testing vary from the verification of the design goals by the robot manufacturer to the determination of the most appropriate robot for a specific use. The purpose of the robot reliability testing program is to obtain knowledge of failures---in particular, robot failure occurrence patterns. Robot reliability tests may be categorized into three broad groups [2]: reliability development and demonstration testing, qualification and acceptance testing, and operational testing.",

  abstract = {Robotics is undergoing a major transformation in scope and dimension.
	Starting from a predominantly industrial focus, robotics has been
	rapidly expanding into the challenges of unstructured environments.
	The Springer Handbook of Robotics incorporates these new developments
	and therefore basically differs from other handbooks of robotics
	focusing on industrial applications. It presents a widespread and
	well-structured coverage from the foundations of robotics, through
	the consolidated methodologies and technologies, up to the new emerging
	application areas of robotics. The handbook is an ideal resource
	for robotics experts but also for people new to this expanding field
	such as engineers, medical doctors, computer scientists, designers.
	
	
	Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in
	the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring,
	and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly
	touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical
	robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of
	a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics
	as a modern scientific discipline. The Springer Handbook of Robotics
	brings a widespreadand well-structured compilation of classic and
	emerging application areas of robotics. From the foundations to the
	social and ethical implications of robotics, the handbook provides
	a comprehensive collection of the accomplishments in the field, and
	constitutes a premise of further advances towards new challenges
	in robotics.
	
	
	This handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with
	the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and onehundred
	sixty-four authors, is an authoritative reference for robotics researchers,
	newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines such
	as biomechanics, neurosciences, virtual simulation, animation, surgery,
	and sensor networks among others.},

abstract = {To solve difficult problems heuristically, requires detailed attention to computational efficiency. This paper describes how a heuristic problem solving system, HPA, attempts to find a near optimal solution to the traveling salesman problem. A critical innovation over previous search algorithms is an explicit dynamic weighting of the heuristic information. The heuristic information is weighted inversely proportional to its depth in the search tree -- in consequence it produces a narrower depth first search than traditional weightings. At the same time, dynamic weighting retains the catastrophe protection of ordinary branch and bound algorithms.},

abstract = {Sensor technologies will play a key role in the success of Remote Maintenance (RM) systems for future fusion reactors. In this paper, three key types of sensor technologies of particular interest in the robotics field at the moment are evaluated, namely: Colour-Depth cameras, LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), and Millimetre-Wave (mmWave) RADAR. The evaluation of the sensors is performed based on the following criteria: the types of data they provide, the accuracy at different distances, and the potential environmental resistance of the sensor (namely gamma radiation). The authors review the progress in making these three types of sensor capable of operating in Fusion facilities and discuss possible mitigations. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the pros and cons of each type of sensor by collecting data from radar, colour-depth camera and LIDAR, simultaneously. The paper concludes with a performance comparison between sensors, as well as discussing the possibility of combining them, fostering redundancy in case of failure of any individual sensor device.}

    abstract = {Outlier removal is a fundamental data processing task to ensure the quality of scanned point cloud data (PCD), which is becoming increasing important in industrial applications and reverse engineering. Acquired scanned PCD is usually noisy, sparse and temporarily incoherent. Thus the processing of scanned data is typically an ill-posed problem. In the paper, we present a simple and effective method based on two geometrical characteristics constraints to trim the noisy points. One of the geometrical characteristics is the local density information and another is the deviation from the local fitting plane. The local density based method provides a preprocessing step, which could remove those sparse outlier and isolated outlier. The non-isolated outlier removal in this paper depends on a local projection method, which placing those points onto objects. There is no doubt that the deviation of any point from the local fitting plane should be a criterion to reduce the noisy points. The experimental results demonstrate the ability to remove the noisy point from various man-made objects consisting of complex outlier.},
