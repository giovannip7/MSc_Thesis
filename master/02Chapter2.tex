\section{Introduction}Man has always spent his life working. Dangerous and degrading work has been the cause of death for many people for centuries. 
In this sense, there has always been a tendency to try to relieve man of the heaviest jobs by looking for machines or automatic systems to replace him.
In a sense, with the advent of the industrial revolution, we witnessed the first real process of robotizing in history.
On the other hand, with the evolution of discoveries in the medical field, the desire and curiosity arose in man to try to clone himself, artificially constructing his own like.
It is here that these two needs and tendencies come together in what we now call humanoid robots.
Indeed, humanoid robots are designed and built to replace humans in the most physical and repetitive tasks, in order to ensure greater well-being.
